                   Hey! I'm Ben, welcome to this little page I made. I was born to Israeli / Brazilian
                parents and we moved to NYC when I was 2. I spent most of my development years in NYC (except
                for half of my highschool years which were spent in Brazil). After high school I decided to be
                somehwat of a nomad, I spent a few years working odd jobs from making promotional videos for 
                small NGOs to working in small shops, with a good 
                habit of getting stuck in places for extended periods of time. In 2013 I moved to Melbourne to attend La 
                Trobe Univercity. After graduating with a BA in International Development as well as 
                doing a Permaculture Design Course (PDC), I went to and island off the southern coast 
                of Cambodia to work for an NGO there called 
                <a href="https://www.friendsofkohrong.org/" class="link">Friends of Koh Rong</a> 
                and worked with a local community teaching english and sustainable designs. I've returned to Australia
                since then have been studying coding and programming.
